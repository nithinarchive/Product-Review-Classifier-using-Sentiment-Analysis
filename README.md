# Sentiment Analysis on Online Product Reviews  
**Author:** Nithin Suresh  

This project aims to **analyze online product reviews to understand user sentiment and satisfaction**. By combining **web scraping, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and natural language processing (NLP)**, this project transforms raw textual reviews into actionable insights that help product teams and businesses make data-driven decisions.  

The focus is on comparing actual product ratings with sentiment analysis scores to **evaluate how well textual feedback aligns with numerical ratings**, offering a deeper understanding of customer perception.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Features  

### 1. Web Scraping  
- Utilized **Prowebscraper** to extract a large set of online product reviews from e-commerce platforms.  
- Ensured a **comprehensive and diverse dataset**, capturing reviews across different ratings and user profiles.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Performed in-depth exploration using **Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib** to visualize trends, patterns, and anomalies in the dataset.  
- Identified insights such as **frequent keywords, rating distributions, and sentiment trends**.  
- Created comparative visualizations to better understand **how different product features influence user satisfaction**.  

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Leveraged **NLTK** to preprocess textual data (tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming).  
- Applied **sentiment intensity analyzers** to convert textual reviews into quantifiable sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative).  
- Enabled **numeric analysis of qualitative data**, bridging the gap between user expressions and measurable insights.  

### 4. Rating Comparison  
- Aligned **sentiment compound scores** with actual review ratings.  
- Evaluated **how well sentiment analysis reflects actual user satisfaction**, identifying potential discrepancies between numerical ratings and textual feedback.  
- Visualized results for **easy interpretation and actionable insights**.
